description: "Motion software like After Effects are extremely powerful and an important part of any designers toolkit. But with any motion software the best you can hope for is an simulation of the actual experience. Prototyping with developer tools like Xcode aren't simulations, they are mini apps that will bring you as close to the final experience as you can possibly get."
